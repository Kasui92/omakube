<h1 align="center">Omarell</h1>

Omarell is a personalized fork of [Omakub](https://omakub.org), the one-liner tool that turns a fresh Ubuntu install into a modern development environment. It builds on Omakub with targeted tweaks for a more streamlined and opinionated Linux setup.

The name comes from umarell, the Italian archetype of a retiree watching construction sites with a critical eye. Likewise, Omarell keeps tabs on the evolving [Omarchy project](https://omarchy.org), selectively adopting useful changes while staying grounded on a stable, proven base.

## Installation

Omarell is designed to transform a fresh **Ubuntu Server LTS** installation into a complete development environment. Make sure you have:

- A fresh Ubuntu Server LTS installation (24.04)
- A stable internet connection (the setup downloads packages and extensions)
- At least 30 minutes for the complete installation process

To install Omarell, simply run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
curl -sSL https://omakasui.org/omarell | bash
```

You can also install Omarell in its "development" version to experiment and/or contribute, but you accept all the risks involved (and a few coffees won't always be enough). This is the command, for the brave:

```bash
curl -sSL https://omakasui.org/omarell-dev | bash
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> ### Still want to use the old version?
>
> If you're looking for the stable Ubuntu Desktop-based version (v1.x), you can find it in the [`legacy`](https://github.com/KAsui92/omarell/tree/legacy) branch.
>
> Run: `eval "$(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kasui92/omarell/legacy/boot.sh)"`

## Key Features

- **Built on Ubuntu Server**: A lean and stable LTS foundation, stripped of superfluous services and packages.
- **Minimal yet GNOME-powered**: Only the essential GNOME components, with Wayland as the default session and no unnecessary bloat.
- **No Snaps. Ever.**: Snap is completely removed. Applications are sourced from Flatpak or directly from trusted packages.
- **Smart window management**: Pre-configured tiling with Forge extension, 6 workspaces, and keyboard-driven workflow optimizations.
- **Silent post-install magic**: The setup continues automatically after rebootâ€”fully hands-off, zero interaction required.
- **Umarell spirit, Omakub roots**: Forked from Omakub, driven by the same passion for usability, but with the hands-on curiosity and practical eye of an Umarell.
