# Omakube

Omakube is a personalized fork of [Omakub](https://omakub.org), the one-liner tool that turns a fresh Ubuntu install into a modern development environment. It builds on Omakub with targeted tweaks for a more streamlined and opinionated Linux setup. Likewise, Omakube keeps tabs on the evolving [Omarchy](https://omarchy.org) project, selectively adopting useful changes while staying grounded on a stable, proven base.
