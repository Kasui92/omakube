<h1 align="center">Omarell</h1>

Omarell is a customized fork of [Omakub](https://omakub.org) that offers additional personalizations for an even more refined Linux experience.

## What is Omarell?

Omarell is a personalized fork of [Omakub](https://omakub.org), the one-liner tool that turns a fresh Ubuntu install into a modern development environment. It builds on Omakub with targeted tweaks for a more streamlined and opinionated Linux setup.

The name comes from umarell, the Italian archetype of a retiree watching construction sites with a critical eye. Likewise, Omarell keeps tabs on the evolving [Omarchy project](https://omarchy.org), selectively adopting useful changes while staying grounded on a stable, proven base.

# Installation

To install Omarell, simply run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
curl -sSL https://omakasui.org/omarell | bash
```

You can also install Omarell in its "development" version to experiment and/or contribute, but you accept all the risks involved (and a few coffees won't always be enough). This is the command, for the brave:

```bash
curl -sSL https://omakasui.org/omarell-dev | bash
```

## Key Features

- **All Omakub benefits...**: the base is Omakub and that remains, solid and proven
- **...with Omarchy approach**: With the philosophy and vibes of Omarchy, in its themes and in the way of managing the desktop.
- **Lightweight base installation**: minimal core setup without suggested applications (most are optional) and initial theme selection
- **Updated menu system**: reorganized, cleaned up, and enhanced system menus for better organization and usability
- **A CLI for terminal people**: it's still based on the Menu, but without the effort of interaction. Clean and simple.
- **Enhanced GNOME customizations**: additional desktop tweaks and interesting enhancements, like GDM background sync, Forge Extension for a WM desktop and consistency fixes
- **No Snaps!**: removed snap and replaced all applications with Flatpak or from sources
