<h1 align="center">Omarell</h1>

Omarell is a customized fork of [Omakub](https://omakub.org) that offers additional personalizations for an even more refined Linux experience.

## What is Omarell?

The name "Omarell" is derived from the Italian term "umarell" (often spelled "omarell" in some dialects), which refers to retired elderly men who stand watching construction sites, often with their hands clasped behind their backs, offering unsolicited advice to workers. It's a popular cultural reference in Italy that embodies curious observation and gentle improvement suggestions.

In the spirit of its namesake, Omarell takes the base Omakub system—which transforms a fresh Ubuntu installation into a fully-configured, modern development environment with a single command—and adds its own improvements and extra customizations, watching over and enhancing the original work.

# Installation

To install Omarell, simply run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
curl -sSL https://omakasui.lucapattocchio.dev/omarell | bash
```

You can also install Omarell in its "development" version to experiment and/or contribute, but you accept all the risks involved (and a few coffees won't always be enough). This is the command, for the brave:

```bash
curl -sSL https://omakasui.lucapattocchio.dev/omarell-dev | bash
```

## Key Features

- **All Omakub benefits**: the base is Omakub and that remains, with a few more updates and a few less default apps
- **Lightweight base installation**: minimal core setup without suggested applications (most are optional) and initial theme selection
- **Updated menu system**: reorganized, cleaned up, and enhanced system menus for better organization and usability
- **Enhanced GNOME customizations**: additional desktop tweaks and interesting enhancements, like GDM background sync and consistency fixes
- **No Snaps!**: removed snap and replaced all applications with Flatpak or from sources
